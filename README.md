# Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a simple framework for general-purpose configuration and code logic de-coupling.
It was developed to offer two main functionalities:

**De-coupling**
   a code logic from its regulating parameters

**Re-use**
   of code logic without effort

## Features

**General-purpose**
   ``cinnamon`` is meant to **simplify** your code organization for better **re-use**.

**Simple**
   ``cinnamon`` is a small library that acts as a **high-level wrapper** for your projects.

**Modular**
   ``cinnamon`` is shipped in **several small packages** to meet different requirements.

**Community-based**
   the ``Component`` and ``Configuration`` you define can be **imported from/exported to** other users and project!

**Flexible**
   ``cinnamon`` imposes **minimal APIs** for a quick learning curve.

**You are still free to code as you like!**


## Packages
